## Objectives

To assess whether stratification by cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk will identify patients with a more favorable risk/benefit profile for intensive BP lowering.

## Required R packages
- [survival](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/index.html)
- [rpart](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rpart/index.html)
- other plotting packages: [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html) and [rpart.plot](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rpart.plot/index.html)
